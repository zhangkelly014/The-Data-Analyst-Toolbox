1. Avoid using SELECT * Only Select Fields You Need   
 
2. Use LIMIT to sample query results   

3. Use wildcards at the end of a phrase only   

4. Making joins less complicated   

5. Reduce nested views to reduce lags   

6. Data pre-staging   

7. Donâ€™t count everything in the table   

8. Check Indexes

9. Limit Size of Your Working Data Set. 
- Examine the tables used in the SELECT statement to see if you can apply filters in the WHERE clause of your statement. 

10. Remove Unnecessary Tables

11. Remove OUTER JOINS

12. Remove Calculated Fields in JOIN and WHERE Clauses

13. Avoid using OR in the WHERE-clause if not all colums have an index

14. Avoid using NOT IN. Instead use EXIST, NOT EXIST, IN or LEFT OUTER JOIN with a check for a NULL condition

15. Avoid using IN when EXISTS is also possible

16. Avoid using IN when BETWEEN is also possible

17. Avoid using SUBSTRING in the WHERE-clause. If possible use LIKE instead

18. Don't use ORDER BY if you don't really need it

19. In case using LIKE on CHAR of VARCHAR colums quite often consider using the full-text search option
